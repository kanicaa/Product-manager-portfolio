# GreenCard Carbon Offset Program - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary
GreenCard by Mastercard is an innovative eco-friendly credit card designed to reward environmentally conscious consumers by contributing to carbon offset projects with every purchase. In a market increasingly driven by sustainability, this program provides a clear way for users to understand and reduce their carbon footprint, thereby aligning their spending habits with their values.  
This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive carbon offset program integrated within GreenCard. The program will track users' spending, calculate real-time carbon offset contributions, and offer incentives such as bonus offsets and exclusive rewards. The initiative aims to drive increased card usage, support sustainable initiatives, and enhance Mastercard's position as a leader in eco-friendly financial solutions. The development is planned over a 12-week period, with iterative testing and pilot launches to gather actionable user feedback.
